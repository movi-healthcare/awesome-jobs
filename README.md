# awesome-jobs

We're continuing to grow our team and have solidied funding so runway is not a worry.   We've already hired a few devs but still are looking to fill out that team.  Ops and support openings will be posted in the near future!


[Mezzo Software Engineer](http://b.link/movi-github-mezzo): Mid-level aka intermediate is totes corporate...and Mezzo just sounds fancy. We want someone who plans on advancing quickly, with a desire to become a Killer Software Engineer.

If you think you're above these...we're happy to entertain hiring, uh, higher than we were planning
