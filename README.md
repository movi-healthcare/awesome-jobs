# awesome-jobs

We're looking to grow our team...let's do this!  Initially we're hiring devs, but will have operations and support openings in the near future.


[Pioneer Software Engineer](http://b.link/movi-github-pioneer): Entry-level is too corporate and isn't what we're seeking....we're looking for newer-to-development but driven, can-do peeples to help us both grow together.

[Mezzo Software Engineer](http://b.link/movi-github-mezzo): Mid-level aka intermediate is also totes corporate...and Mezzo just sounds fancy. We want someone who plans on advancing quickly, with a desire to become a Killer Software Engineer.

If you think you're above these...we're happy to entertain hiring, uh, higher than we were planning
