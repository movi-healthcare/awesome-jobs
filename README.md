We're looking to hire all levels of developers so don't hesitate to submit your resume if a job description below does not match your experience to the :tea


[Team Player](http://b.link/movi-github-team-player): Mid-level aka intermediate is pass√©...and we really don't want to put someone in a box. We want someone who plans on advancing quickly and help the greater good of the team as you grow.

[Quality Team Player](http://b.link/movi-github-quality-team-player): QA Engineer is too QA-y and isn't exactly what we're seeking....we're looking for someone who likes the Quality Assurance aspects of software development, particularly automated testing but can also participate in other areas of the development cycle.  We're small and it's all hands on deck!

If you think you don't match these criteria but are interesting in all things movi...we're happy to entertain hiring all levels/areas of skill.
